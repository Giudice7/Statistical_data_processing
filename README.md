# Energy data analysis through statistical processes

This repository contains two case-study of statistical data analytics on energy data developed for the Ph.D. course of *Statistical data processing* 2022/23 held at the Politecnico di Torino.

The teachers involved are:
* Prof. Marco Piras ([Link](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=marco.piras))
* Prof. Paolo Dabove ([Link](https://www.polito.it/personale?p=paolo.dabove))
* Ph.D. Eng. Vincenzo di Pietra ([Link](https://www.polito.it/personale?p=vincenzo.dipietra))

The report carried out from the analysis were developed using [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), a format for writing reproducible, dynamic reports with R. The format used is HTML documents, in order to obtain interactive and dynamic visualizations.

The two case-study analyzed are:
* **Multiple linear regression for energy data**: a regression analysis on a heating season dataset for a building has been performed, improving the accuracy of the model through the identification of outliers employing the Cook's distance.
* **High dimensional clustering for Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs)**: a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) coupled with K-means clustering was investigated in order to group buildings with similar attributes in the domain of EPCs. Greater attention was given to the interpretability phase, where clustering results were explained through the representation of variable distributions.
